# Omarchy CLI

Omarchy is usually controlled through the hotkeys and the Omarchy menu (`Super + Space`). But you can also control it through the `omarchy` CLI. This is particularly helpful when you're having an AI agent work with you on customization or configuration.

The CLI has access to all the internal tooling that is used both via the menu and otherwise. You can see everything that's available by running `omarchy` in the terminal.

It looks something like this:

```
~ ❯ omarchy

Every command takes `--help` too, whether you ask a whole group (`omarchy capture --help`) or a single command (`omarchy capture screenshot --help`).

### Opening the menu from the terminal

The Omarchy menu is scriptable as well, which is handy for your own keybindings. `omarchy menu` opens it at the root, and you can jump straight to any point in the tree by naming it: `omarchy menu summon style.theme` goes right to the theme picker, `omarchy menu toggle system` opens the system menu and closes it again if it's already up, and `omarchy menu close` puts it away.
